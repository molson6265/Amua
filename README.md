## Welcome to Amua 

Amua is an open source modeling framework and probabilistic programming language.  From the Swahili word for "decide"/"solve", Amua is designed to be:
* **Transparent**: The graphical user interface provides an intuitive way to develop and document models.  As an open source framework, the underlying code is always available.
* **Flexible**: Models can be run in Amua or [exported](https://github.com/zward/Amua/wiki/Export) to other programming languages.  This allows conceptual models to be separated from any particular implementation, making it easy to change model platforms.
* **Accessible**:  Amua is free software and can be used as a teaching tool, or by researchers seeking an integrated modeling environment.  The software is lightweight and can be used on any operating system with a Java Virtual Machine installed.
* **Bayesian**: As a probabilistic programming language, Amua allows model parameters to be treated as random variables and fit to data via [model calibration](https://github.com/zward/Amua/wiki/Model-Calibration) using a variety of techniques.

Model types:
* <img src="https://github.com/zward/Amua/blob/gh-pages/images/modelTree_16.png"> [Decision Trees](https://github.com/zward/Amua/wiki/Decision-Trees)
* <img src="https://github.com/zward/Amua/blob/gh-pages/images/markovChain_16.png"> [Markov Models](https://github.com/zward/Amua/wiki/Markov-Models)
* Discrete Event Simulation (planned)
* Compartmental Models (planned)

Models can be run as cohort or individual-level simulations (i.e. microsimulation).
